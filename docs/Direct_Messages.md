# Direct Messages (Alpha)

**Sadly this feature had to be removed temporarily due to Mastodon rate limiting. It will be re-added once a solution is found.**

---

AirportStatusBot supports direct message conversations. This allows you to get information from the bot without having to read every post.

## Commands

`List all delays` - This will list all current delays at airports in the United States.
`Where do you get your data?` - This will tell you where the bot gets its data from.
`Who created you?` - This will tell you who created the bot.

There are a few other commands that are available, but aren't listed here. This is due to the fact that they are intended to increase the conversational aspect of the bot and not really meant to be used as official commands. Plus a few of them are just hidden easter eggs.

## Other Information

- The bot will only respond to direct messages. It will **not** reply to public mentions.
- The bot will try to respond to many variations of the commands listed above. If you try a variation and it doesn't work, **please** submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/fishcharlie/AirportStatusBot/issues/new). I'm really interested in making this experience as intuitive and easy as possible.
- If you have suggestions for other commands that should be added, please submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/fishcharlie/AirportStatusBot/issues/new).
- This feature is in alpha. This means that it is still being developed and may not work as expected. If you encounter any issues, please submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/fishcharlie/AirportStatusBot/issues/new).
